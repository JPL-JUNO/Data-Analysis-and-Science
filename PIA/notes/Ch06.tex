\section{Letter casing and whitespace}
The Series object’s str attribute exposes a StringMethods object, a powerful toolbox of methods for working with strings
\section{String slicing}
\section{String slicing and character replacement}
\section{Boolean methods}
The contains method checks for a substring’s inclusion in each Series value. The method returns True when pandas finds the method’s argument within the row’s string and False when it does not.

\section{Splitting strings}
To ensure an equal number of elements per list, we can limit the number of splits. If we set a maximum threshold of one split, pandas will split a string at the first space and stop. Then we’ll have a Series consisting of two-element lists. Each list will hold the customer’s first name and anything that follows it.

We can use str.get to pull out a value from each row’s list based on its index position.
