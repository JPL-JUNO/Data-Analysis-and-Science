\subsection{Extracting rows by index label}
We can use loc to extract a sequence of index labels. The syntax mirrors Pythonâ€™s list slicing syntax. We provide the starting value, a colon, and the ending value. For extractions like this one, I strongly recommended sorting the index first, as it accelerates the speed with which pandas finds the value.

\subsection{Extracting values from specific columns}
We can use two alternative attributes, at and iat, when we know that we want to extract a single value from a DataFrame. The two attributes are speedier because pandas can optimize its searching algorithms when looking for a single value.
