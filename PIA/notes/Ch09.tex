\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A GroupBy object is a container of DataFrames.
    \item Pandas buckets rows into GroupBy DataFrames by using values across one or more columns.
    \item The \verb|first| and \verb|last| methods return the first and last rows from each GroupBy group. The row order in the original DataFrame determines the row order in each group.
    \item The head and tail methods extract multiple rows from each group in the GroupBy object based on the rowâ€™s positions in the original DataFrame.
    \item The \verb|nth| method extracts a row from each GroupBy group by its index position.
    \item Pandas can perform aggregate calculations such as sum, average, max, and min for each group in a GroupBy object.
    \item The agg method applies different aggregate operations to different columns. We pass it a dictionary with columns as keys and aggregation as values.
    \item The apply method invokes a function on each DataFrame in a GroupBy object.
