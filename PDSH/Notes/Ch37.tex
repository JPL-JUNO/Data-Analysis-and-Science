\section{Summary}
In short, we saw the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised learning: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Classification: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
              \item Regression: Models that predict continuous labels
          \end{itemize}
    \item Unsupervised learning: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Clustering: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data
              \item Dimensionality reduction: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
