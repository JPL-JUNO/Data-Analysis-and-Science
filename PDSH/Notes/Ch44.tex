\chapter{In Depth: Decision Trees and Random Forests\label{Ch44}}
Here we'll take a look at another powerful algorithm: a nonparametric
algorithm called random forests. Random forests are an example of an ensemble
method, meaning one that relies on aggregating the results of a set of simpler estimators.

\section{Summary}
A primary disadvantage of random forests is that the results are not easily interpretable: that is, if you would like to draw conclusions about the meaning of the classification model, random forests may not be the best choice.
