# Simple Linear Regression

## Coefficients of correlation and determination

### Coefficients of correlation

In general, correlation does not imply causation.

### Coefficients of determination

The coefficient of determination is just $r^2$ , where $r$ is the coefficient of correlation, which is a proportion of the variation in the variable $y$, explained by the variable $x$.

## Required model assumptions

### Homoscedasticity of the residuals

There are a few common ways the homoscedasticity of the residuals could be violated:

- The residuals show a systematic change in variance
- There is an extreme outlier

### Testing for significance and validating models

#### Validating models

##### The Durbin-Watson test
