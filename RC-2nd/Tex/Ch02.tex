\section{Printing Something to the Screen}
The beauty of print is that it knows how to format any R value for printing, including structured values such as matrices and lists.

The print function has a significant limitation, however: it prints only one object at a time. Trying to print multiple items gives error message.

The cat function is an alternative to print that lets you concatenate multiple items into a continuous output.

Notice that cat puts a space between each item by default. You must provide a newline character ($\backslash$n) to terminate the line.

A serious limitation, however, is that it cannot print compound data structures such as matrices and lists.
